OVERVIEW:

  These MATLAB programs implement the Block Compressed Sensing -
  Smoothed Projected Landweber (BCS-SPL) algorithm as described in
  paper:
  
    S. Mun and J. E. Fowler, "Block Compressed Sensing of Images
    Using Directional Transforms," submitted to the IEEE
    International Conference on Image Processing, 2009

  Specifically, this code reproduces the experiment results of the
  paper (Table 1), for the BCS-SPL-CT, BCS-SPL-DDWT, BCS-SPL-DWT, and
  BCS-SPL-DCT algorithms. Respectively, the code for these is:

    run_experiment_ct.m
    run_experiment_ddwt.m
    run_experiment_dwt.m
    run_experiment_dct.m
  
  This code relies on the Contourlet Toolbox
  (http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~minhdo/software/) as well as the
  Wavelet Software package (http://eeweb.poly.edu/iselesni/WaveletSoftware/).
  Both will need to reside within the current MATLAB search path.

  Note that, since most of this code relies on random projections,
  the results produced may differ slightly in appearance and
  value from those of the paper.
